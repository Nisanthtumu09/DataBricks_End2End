**End to End Databricks Project**
The objective of this project is to build an end-to-end data engineering project with Databricks community edition following medallion architecture, which involves data ingestion from GitHub(https) and ADLSGen2 covering incremental loading using autoloader serving as bronze layer with unity catalog. Then silver layer contains the transformations using pyspark function, leveraging oops concept for data enrichment and functions in unity catalog for reusability. In gold layer, Integrating slowly changing dimension types 1and 2 with star schema and building delta live tables. Finally serving the data to warehouse for analytical reporting.

âœ… Key Goals: â€¢ Automate Data Ingestion: Seamlessly ingest data from sources into ADLS Gen2 storage using incremental loading with unity catalog
â€¢ Implement Medallion Architecture: Organize and transform data through bronze, silver, and gold layers to improve data quality and accessibility.
 â€¢ Enable Data Transformation & Enrichment: Leverage Azure Databricks for data processing with pyspark functions and oop concepts.
 â€¢ Optimize Analytics : Using dimensional data modelling with star schema and delta live tables for efficient querying, analytics, and reporting on large datasets. 
â€¢ Create Interactive Visualizations: Build dynamic dashboards with Power BI/Tableau/Fabric to provide meaningful business insights. 
â€¢ Ensure Production-Readiness: Apply best practices for performance optimization, error handling, monitoring, and maintenance.
